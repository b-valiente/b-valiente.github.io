<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
We needed to develop a straightforward "paint" program that would accept mouse input from users and let them draw on the screen.

An easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) program that lets the user paint using a selection of colors from the keyboard and a position for the brush strokes from the mouse.

<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>

I learned more about Java variables and user input with this project. It also taught me how to properly assign variable types, organize my code, and deal with documentation when programming.
