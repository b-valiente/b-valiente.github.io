Growing up I was always interested in technology, especially Apple. I would watch all those tech vlog related videos and the apple keynotes all when I was in middle school. Going into my freshman year of high school, I ended up building my first PC. This is what sparked my interest in everything technology hardware and software. Combining both my interests in software and hardware, I chose computer science as my major.

Being completely honest I do not have much confidence in my programming skills as of now. Before taking this course, the last time I programmed for school was in 2020 due to the fact that I had to complete many prerequisites in order to qualify for the upper ICS classes which took a few semesters to complete. Even though my knowledge isn’t as foundationally strong as I’d like it to be, many different concepts from Java, and C/C++ carried over to JavaScript which helped me understand the language a little better. Overall I am anxious moving forward but also really excited to polish my skills.

With that being said, with my rocky foundation with programming and the anxiety about moving forward, Overall I am excited to move forward with this course and hopefully polish my programming skills along with building professional skills to help me succeed in the real world. Also, I would like to acquire an internship moving forward with this course. After graduation I hope to acquire a job at any top tech company as either a software engineer or a cyber security analyst.
